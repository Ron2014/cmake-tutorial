# Intro

Check these code from cmake-3.16.1/Help/guid/tutorial/.

For learning CMake, I will follow [official tutorial document](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html#id1) and do changes in theses files.

More offical repo, I search into these address:

[repo for CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/tree/master)

[repo for CMake Tutorial](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/tree/master/Help/guide/tutorial)

Pay attention to the different between official document and repo.
